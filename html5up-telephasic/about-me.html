								<h3>Academics <strong></strong></h3>
								<p>As of December 2023, I will have graduated with my Bachelors of Arts & Sciences from Western Illinois University. I'm an aspiring Political Science Pre-Law major and a Professional Writing minor. I will be getting my master's in Public Policy & Administration starting Spring 2024.</p>

								<p>The course work that I have taken in the past three and half years and future year and a half will contirbute significantly to the work I plan on pursuing in the future after leaving Macomb.</p>

								<h3>Interests & Values <strong></strong></h3>
								<p>I am deeply passionate about advocating for those who are unable to speak up for themselves and promoting mental health awareness. My commitment to these causes stems from a genuine belief in the power of empathy, compassion, and education to drive positive change in our society. I am dedicated to being a voice for the voiceless, whether it's advocating for marginalized communities, indivudals with disabilities, or those struggling with mental health issues. I believe that fostering an understanding, acceptance, and support for these individuals is not only a moral imperative but also an essential step toward building a more inclusive and passionate world.</p>

								<h3>In the Future <strong></strong></h3>
								<p>My future goals are anchored in a deep commitment to improving mental health services and access within our communities, especially to those victim of sexual assault. My vision is to become a mental health site administrator, overseeing the management and operations of mental health facilities. In the long term, becoming a mental health site administrator is not just a career aspiration, but rather a way to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those struggling with mental health challenges. It aligns with my passion for public service, healthcare, and my desire to contribute to a more compassionate and accessible mental health system in our society</p>
