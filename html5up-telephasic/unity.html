									<h2>Unity on the Plate</h2>
									<p>Exploring The Vital Role of Community In Food Insecurity</p>

								<p>Community is highly important in combatting the issue of food insecurity. Clarabut's article suggests that <a href= https://wellbeingpeople.com/workplace-wellbeing/the-importance-of-an-engaging-community/2023/#:~:text=Being%20part%20of%20an%20engaging,other%2C%20ourselves%20and%20our%20environment.> being apart of an engaging community gives us</a> a sense of belonging and enables us to share our personal relatedness and support perpetual growth of each other, ourselves and our environment. When we come together to help one another it embraces spirit, character, image and pride. It allows us to feel that we matter to one another and that our needs with be met through commitment and togetherness.</p>

								<p>In our communities, we can take small steps to help provide for those who are facing issues of food insecurities. In Katre and Raddatz research, <a href= https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15051271>Doustmohammadian recognizes</a> that we need to make food available, accessible, and stable. To make it available to others, we can come together to work on infrastructure development, food security programs, and even local gardening. To make it accessible, local stores could offer more vouchers and discounts to those who have verified they have struggled with affording groceries. Additionally, these stores may also want to consider the pricing of their food, if possible. To ensure it is stable, there needs to be an improved production and productivity of agriculture. This would include more comprehensive and equitable access to seed, water, fertilizers and credit by smallholder farmers.</p>

								<p>Upon implementing these few things, communities may potentially rid completely of food insecurity. Each home would have nutritious and delicious foods without the worry of how they will pay their bills or afford childcare. Community shapes everything when it comes to food insecurity, we need to come together to fight this issue head on.</p>
